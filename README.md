🎓 **Student Pass and Fail Data Analysis and Visualization**

📌 **Project Overview**

This project analyzes student performance data to identify patterns between pass and fail students.
The goal is to explore key factors affecting student results using data analysis and visualization techniques.

📊 **Objectives**

Clean and preprocess student dataset

Detect and remove outliers

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize pass vs fail distribution

Generate meaningful insights

🛠 **Tools & Technologies**

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

📂 **Dataset Features (Example)**

Study Hours

Attendance

Previous Grades

Test Scores

Final Result (Pass/Fail)

📈**Visualizations Included**

Bar Chart (Pass vs Fail Count)

Box Plot (Score Distribution)

Histogram (Marks Distribution)

Correlation Heatmap

🔍 **Key Insights**

Students with higher attendance are more likely to pass.

Study hours show a positive correlation with final grades.

Outliers were detected using the IQR method.
